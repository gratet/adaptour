teaser: "The general research objective of the project is to examine, understand and translate into theoretical approaches, empirical observations and practical conversations, the processes through which destinations are responding to the challenges of global change (and in particular to climate change and the de-carbonization of the productive system), in terms of mitigating its effects, transforming socio-spatial dynamics, changing mobility regimes, and the enhancing of social justice with the aim of increasing resilience."

From a methodological perspective, the research will unleash the potential of such dimensions by integrating them in different Work Packages (WP). This necessitates a rethinking of existing concepts and models available for studying destination evolutionary (and in some cases metamorphic) transformation (WP2) under current global transition dynamics (WP1). It includes analysis of the main policy transitions that tourism destinations are undergoing: information technology tools related to digital data analysis, deployment of a new communication strategies and the setting of new governance agendas for reinforcing resilience and sustainability (WP3). Finally, the project also includes transversal activities aiming to monitor ethics and gender issues and increase its broader social and academic impact (WP4).

Listed briefly, clearly, precisely and realistically and taking into account that a project will be carried out during four years, 10 objectives are set out in four Work Packages. The PI responsible for WP1 and WP3 (Objectives 1, 6, 7 and 8) as well as Objective 10 of WP4 is Salvador Anton Clavé, while the PI responsible for WP2 (Objectives 2, 3, 4 and 5) and Objective 9 of WP4 is Aaron Gutiérrez.

###### Objective 8: To define visions, metrics and tools to assess resilience of complex destinations in the face of global change and to design and new systems of governance which are fit to increase adaptability.
